# Voyager 1
NASA originally planned to send two spacecraft past Jupiter, Saturn and Pluto and two other probes past Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune. Budgetary reasons forced the agency to scale back its plans, but NASA still got a lot out of the two Voyagers it launched. Voyager 2 flew past Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, while Voyager 1 focused on Jupiter and Saturn.

Voyager 1 is the first spacecraft to reach interstellar space. It originally was launched in 1977 to explore the outer planets in our solar system. However, it has remained operational long past expectations and continues to send information about its journeys back to Earth. 

Recognizing that the Voyagers would fly out of the solar system, NASA authorized the production of two records to be placed on board the spacecraft. Sounds ranging from whale calls to the music of Chuck Berry were placed on board, as well as spoken greetings in 55 languages.

## Objective
Recreation of the Voyager 1 probe path in an n-body system.

## Initial Conditions

This table contains the initial conditions of the system Voyager 1 traveled on its path to reach the Jupiter and Saturn flyby on 9/5/1997 (each at time 00:00:00 in TDB). The data was generated by JPL's HORIZONS at https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi
